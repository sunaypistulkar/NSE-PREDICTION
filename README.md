# NSE-PREDICTION

## Approach
1. I have used *tensorflows and keras* **LSTM** model to predict the NIFTY index for next 40 days.
2. The prediction is based on the closing value of the stock of each day.
3. To get independent variables, I have used last 50 days value of the given stock with the help of hyper-parameter tuning. (100 day for stock might be inappropriate as market is very volatile.)
4. Predicted 51st day's value with LSTM.
5. Used graphics to visualise the graphs(EDA).
